    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        I have been working as a translator for around 5 years now and have reached almost the limit of what I can achieve in that field in Georgia.
        Therefore, I decided to go with coding. It has been my passion since I was around 12 to solve problems, puzzles and other kinds of interesting logical equations
        and I think I can apply all this enthusiasm to coding. I have already learned some of HTML and CSS and JavaScript on my own, but I am hoping I can go into more depth
        within this course. I am a very quick learner and pretty creative too. I think my personal qualities such as friendliness, team worker, empathy towards others should
        very much help me become something more than just a regular coder (even if I become a regular coder that is still fine).
    </p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>As I already mentioned I do not have much experience in programing however, I know basics of:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>CSS;</li>
        <li>JavaScript;</li>
        <li>VScode;</li>
        <li>GitHub.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Code Examples</h3>
    <p>Not much but its honest work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>https://github.com/Tupical-Dave/HTML-CSS-Course.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I have passed the first stage of BitCamp (Georgian Project);</li>
        <li>Am halfway through the second stage of BitCamp;</li>
        <li>Link for the work done during the project is above. Although, the whole first stage was about JavaScript, it was all performed on the platform, therefore I do not have access to the code I wrote there.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I have a Bachelor's Degree in the field of International Relations at Free University of Georgia (Kakha Bendukidze Campus);</li>
        <li>For Courses and experience in Coding, see the section above.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Foreign Languages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Georgian (fluent), have been living in Georgia for my whole life;</li>
        <li>Russian (Speaking level fluent)**. My family is Armenian so almost through my whole life I was speaking Russian at home. However, I am pretty bad at writing;</li>
        <li>English (fluent), was studying at English school for around 7 years. Learned all the subjects like Biology, Chemistry, Physics in English. Have many English speaking friends;</li>
        <li>German (B1 level), have been learning this language for several years now, however, due to the lack of practice I keep forgetting it;</li>
        <li class="last">Chinese (A2 level)**, it was my Major during Bachelor years and according to the Diploma I know this language on the level of C2, however, I didn't use this language for around 4 years now, therefore I lost almost all the knowledge, well not lost but it definitely is sleeping somewhere in the depth of my mind.</li>
