### Summary
I have been working as a translator for around 5 years now and have reached almost the limit of what I can achieve in that field in Georgia.
Therefore, I decided to go with coding. It has been my passion since I was around 12 to solve problems, puzzles and other kinds of interesting logical equations
and I think I can apply all this enthusiasm to coding. I have already learned some of HTML and CSS and JavaScript on my own, but I am hoping I can go into more depth
within this course. I am a very quick learner and pretty creative too. I think my personal qualities such as friendliness, team worker, empathy towards others should
very much help me become something more than just a regular coder (even if I become a regular coder that is still fine).

### Skills
As I already mentioned I do not have much experience in programing however, I know basics of:
- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- VScode;
- GitHub.

### Code Examples
Not much but its honest work:
- https://github.com/Tupical-Dave/HTML-CSS-Course
 
### Experience
- I have passed the first stage of BitCamp (Georgian Project);
- Am halfway through the second stage of BitCamp;
- Link for the work done during the project is above. Although, the whole first stage was about JavaScript, it was all performed on the platform,
  therefore I do not have access to the code I wrote there.
  
### Education
- I have a Bachelor's Degree in the field of International Relations at Free University of Georgia (Kakha Bendukidze Campus);
- For Courses and experience in Coding, see the section above.

### Foreign Languages
- **Georgian (fluent)**, have been living in Georgia for my whole life;
- **Russian (Speaking level fluent)**. My family is Armenian so almost through my whole life I was speaking Russian at home. However, I am pretty bad at writing;
- **English (fluent)**, was studying at English school for around 7 years. Learned all the subjects like Biology, Chemistry, Physics in English. Have many English
  speaking friends;
- **German (B1 level)**, have been learning this language for several years now, however, due to the lack of practice I keep forgetting it;
- **Chinese (A2 level)**, it was my Major during Bachelor years and according to the Diploma I know this language on the level of C2, however, I didn't use this
  language     for around 4 years now, therefore I lost almost all the knowledge, well not lost but it definitely is sleeping somewhere in the depth of my mind.
